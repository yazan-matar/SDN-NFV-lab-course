    The ``ncclient``-based PoliCONF NETCONF client manager.

    This class is intentionally not implemented yet, and it is not mandatory
    for you to implement and work with it.

    The purpose of this class is to encourage some generalization of
    ``ncclient`` connection management, to keep repetitive (re-)connection
    details out of your course functions.

    If you want to use such a generalization layer, then just feel free to be
    creative here...
